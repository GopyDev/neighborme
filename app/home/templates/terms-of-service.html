    <br>
    <br>NeighborMe Inc. (“NeighborMe” or the “Company”) provides a platform where women can more easily offer and ask for help. Members (“Neighbors”) complete detailed profiles including areas of interests, skill sets, and the type of assistance or services they are willing to offer as well as the areas or projects in which they foresee needing help. Neighbors can request help with anything from borrowing a cup of sugar to last minute babysitting. NeighborMe's mission is to connect women and help them accomplish more, together.
    <br>
    <br>This Terms of Service Agreement (“Terms of Service”) governs the use of the services offered by NeighborMe through its website (“NeighborMe.co” or the “Site”) or mobile applications. Such services, the Site and mobile applications together are hereinafter collectively referred to as the “Service.” Your use of the Service constitutes your acceptance of and agreement to all of the terms and conditions in the Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, and Community Guidelines. &nbsp;If you object to anything in the Terms of Service, Privacy Policy or Community Guidelines do not use the Service. The Privacy Policy and Community Guidelines are incorporated by reference into these Terms of Service and these Terms of Service, the Privacy Policy and Community Guidelines together are hereinafter referred to as these “Terms.”
    <br>
    <br>1. Description and Limitation of Services
    <br>The Service is a platform developed to facilitate communication between Neighbors. Through the Service, Neighbors can exchange time, skills, services, goods or other items (collectively referred to as “assistance, services or goods”). “Requesting Neighbors” are Neighbors seeking assistance, services or goods. &nbsp;“Offering Neighbors” are Neighbors offering assistance, services or goods. Neighbors set the terms for the exchange of assistance, services or goods. NeighborMe is not a staffing company and does not hire or contract any Neighbors. NeighborMe is not a party to any agreements entered into between Neighbors, nor does it have control over the assistance, services or goods provided by its Neighbors. NeighborMe is not responsible for the conduct of Neighbors, and disclaims any and all liability in this regard to the maximum extent permitted by law.
    <br>
    <br>2. Registration and Account Security
    <br>In order to use the Service, you must register with NeighborMe and create an account (“Account”). Account registration requires you to provide NeighborMe personal information, including your legal name, current address, valid email address and mobile number, and a valid payment method (credit card or debit card). You must be at least 21 years of age to obtain an Account. You agree to maintain complete, accurate, up-to-date Account information. Failure to do so may result in termination or suspension of your Account. Unless otherwise expressly permitted in writing by NeighborMe, you may only possess one Account. &nbsp;You are the sole authorized user of your Account. You are solely responsible for all activity that occurs under your account. You are also responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any password at all times. Should you suspect that an unauthorized party may be using your Account, or you suspect any other breach of security, you agree to notify NeighborMe immediately.
    <br>
    <br>3. Background Checks and User Vetting
    <br> As a Neighbor, you authorize NeighborMe, and acknowledge that for the purpose of promoting the safety of its Service, NeighborMe may subject you to a four-point identification verification process. &nbsp;In addition, NeighborMe reserves the right, but not the obligation to use a third party service provider to conduct a comprehensive criminal background check at the state, federal and local level. Although NeighborMe may perform identity and background checks, NeighborMe cannot confirm that each Neighbor is who they claim to be. &nbsp;Any references on the Site to a Neighbor being “verified” or “background checked” only indicate that the Member has completed a relevant verification process, and nothing else. &nbsp;Any such description is not a guarantee by NeighborMe about a Neighbor’s identity. &nbsp;NeighborMe cannot and does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy or reliability of identity or background check information or any information provided through the Service. When interacting with or deciding whether to accept assistance, services or goods from Neighbors, we recommend that you exercise caution, common sense and due diligence to protect your personal safety and property. NEIGHBORME IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONDUCT, WHETHER ONLINE OR OFFLINE, OF ANY USER OF THE SERVICE AND YOU HEREBY RELEASE NEIGHBORME FROM ANY LIABILITY RELATED THERETO. NEIGHBORME WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, INJURY OR DAMAGE ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE.
    <br>
    <br>4. Billing, Fees and Payment
    <br>Use of the Service may result in charges to you, as a Requesting Neighbor, for the assistance, services or goods you receive from an Offering Neighbor. Alternatively, as an Offering Neighbor, you may be entitled to payment for the assistance, services or goods you provide a Requesting Neighbor. Neighbors will be solely responsible for negotiating and setting pricing terms (“Charges”) for the assistance, services or goods to be provided. &nbsp;The agreed upon Charges should include: (i) the pricing terms agreed to between Neighbors, (ii) any out of pocket expenses agreed to and submitted by an Offering Neighbor in the completion of her assistance, service, or delivery of goods, and (iii) the 10% service fee assessed by NeighborMe for all requests fulfilled through the Service. &nbsp;Any tip or gratuity, if applicable, is at the sole discretion of the Requesting Neighbor. &nbsp;Requesting Neighbors will be responsible for prompt payment of the Charges set by the Offering Neighbor. However, either Neighbor can notify NeighborMe once a Request has been completed. NeighborMe will process payment through its Payment Service Provider (the “PSP”), Stripe. &nbsp;Neighbors will be required to register with the PSP, agree to the PSP’s Terms of Service and provide account information or a payment method to set up their account with the PSP. &nbsp;The PSP Terms of Service are available HERE. By accepting the PSP Terms of Service, you attest that you have reviewed and agreed to the PSP Terms of Service. Please note that NeighborMe is not a party to the PSP Terms of Service and that you, the PSP and any other parties listed in the PSP Terms of Service are the parties to the PSP Terms of Service. NeighborMe has no obligations or liability to any Neighbor under the PSP Terms of Service. Payment for Charges must be made through the Service. Once a Request is accepted, the Requesting Neighbor will be responsible for the total agreed upon Charges. Requests cancelled after acceptance will be charged the full agreed upon Charge, unless otherwise agreed to between Neighbors. Charges paid are final and non-refundable unless otherwise agreed to between the Neighbors. NeighborMe will not be a party to any contracts between Neighbors. Notwithstanding, NeighborMe reserves the right, in its sole discretion (but not the obligation), to (i) place on hold any payment and out of pocket expenses, or (ii) refund, provide credits or arrange for the PSP to do so. After you have received or provided assistance, services or goods through the Service, you will have the opportunity to rate your experience and leave additional feedback about the Neighbor.
    <br>
    <br>5. Promotions
    <br>NeighborMe may from time to time provide certain Neighbors with promotional offers and discounts. &nbsp;All such promotions will be run at the sole discretion of NeighborMe, and can be activated, modified or removed at any time by NeighborMe without advance notice. &nbsp;The liability of any of NeighborMe’s partners to such promotional offers or discounts will be limited pursuant to Section 13 of these Terms of Service. &nbsp; Such promotions may result in different Charges for similar services or goods obtained through the Site; you agree that such promotions, unless also made available to you, will have no bearing on the Charges, if any, applied to you.
    <br>
    <br>6. Release
    <br>NeighborMe’s Service is only a venue for connecting Neighbors. In the event that you have a dispute with one or more Neighbors, you release NeighborMe from any and all claims, demands, or damages (actual or consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes. NeighborMe expressly disclaims any liability that may arise between Neighbors. Any issues or disputes related to the assistance, services or goods provided by or to a Neighbor, or the Charges related to a Request or otherwise concerning the conduct of a Neighbor, must be resolved directly between you and the Neighbor. &nbsp;NeighborMe will not be held responsible and expressly disclaims any liability whatsoever for any claims, demands or damages known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such issues. &nbsp;By using this Site and NeighborMe’s Service, you hereby expressly agree to hold NeighborMe harmless for any claim or controversy that may arise from any disputes between you and any Neighbor or other user of the Site. &nbsp;You agree to take reasonable precautions in all interactions with Neighbors, particularly if you decide to meet or otherwise interact offline.
    <br>
    <br>7. Termination, Suspension and Cancellation of Account
    <br>NeighborMe may in its discretion and without liability to you, with or without cause, with or without prior notice and at any time, limit, terminate or suspend your right to use the Service at any time for any or no reason. &nbsp;NeighborMe will provide you with written or email notice of such termination, and termination will be effective immediately upon delivery of such notice. &nbsp;If NeighborMe suspends or terminates your account for any reason, you are prohibited from re-registering and creating a new account under your name, a fake or borrowed name, or the name of any third party, even if you may be acting on behalf of the third party. Following suspension or termination of your account, NeighborMe reserves the right to send a notice thereof to other Neighbors with whom we believe you may have corresponded via the Site. &nbsp;In addition to terminating or suspending your account, NeighborMe reserves the right to take appropriate legal action, including without limitation pursuing civil, criminal, and injunctive redress. NeighborMe’s decision to terminate a Neighbor’s registration and/or to notify other Neighbor’s with whom we believe the individual has corresponded does not constitute, and should not be interpreted or used as information bearing on, general reputation, personal characteristics, the individual's character, or general reputation, or mode of living. You may cancel your NeighborMe Account at any time by sending an email request to info@neighborme.co. Please note that if your NeighborMe Account is cancelled, NeighborMe will not have an obligation to delete or return to you any content you have posted to the Site, Application and Service, including, but not limited to, any reviews or feedback.

The Service hosts user generated content relating to reviews of specific Neighbors. Such reviews are opinions and not the opinion of NeighborMe, and have not been verified or approved by NeighborMe. You agree that NeighborMe is not liable for any user generated content and has no obligation to either verify or remove any reviews or other information posted on the Site about you or any other Neighbor.

You will not, in any event, settle any claim or matter without the written consent of Company.
    <br>
    <br>15. Dispute Resolution Informal Negotiations.
    <br>To expedite resolution and reduce the cost of any dispute, controversy or claim related to these Terms (“Dispute”), you and NeighborMe agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating any arbitration or court proceeding. Such informal negotiations will commence upon written notice. Your address for such notices is your billing address, with an email copy to the email address you have provided to NeighborMe. NeighborMe’s address for such notices is: Attention: Dispute Resolution, NeighborMe Inc., P.O. Box 2055 Lombard Street #471573, San Francisco, California, 94147Arbitration &nbsp;In the event the parties are not able to resolve any Dispute between them through informal negotiations, then such Dispute will be resolved only by final and binding arbitration pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, conducted by a single neutral arbitrator and administered by the American Arbitration Association. &nbsp;Any election to arbitrate by one party will be final and binding on the other. &nbsp;You acknowledge and agree that you and NeighborMe are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. The arbitration will be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“AAA Consumer Rules”), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation will be governed by the AAA Rules (and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules). If your claim for damages does not exceed USD 10,000, Company will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, you and Company may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator. Exceptions to Alternative Dispute Resolution. Each party retains the right to bring an individual action in small claims court or to seek injunctive or other equitable relief on an individual basis in a federal or state court in San Francisco County, California with respect to any dispute related to the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s intellectual property or proprietary rights. Class Action WaiverYou and Company agree that any arbitration will be limited to the Dispute between Company and you individually; class arbitrations and class/representative/collective actions are not permitted. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND NEIGHBORME ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Company otherwise agree, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. Location of Arbitration. Arbitration will take place in San Francisco County, California. You and Company agree that for any Dispute not subject to arbitration (other than claims proceeding in any small claims court), or where no election to arbitrate has been made, the California state and Federal courts located in San Francisco, California have exclusive jurisdiction and you and Company agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.
    <br>
    <br>16. Governing Law
    <br>These Terms, and any dispute between you and NeighborMe, shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to principles of conflicts of law, provided that the Federal Arbitration Act shall govern the interpretation and enforcement of Section 15, the Arbitration Agreement. Unless you and NeighborMe agree otherwise, in the event that the Arbitration Agreement is found not to apply to you or to a particular claim or dispute (except for small-claims court actions), either as a result of your decision to opt-out of the Arbitration Agreement or as a result of a decision by the arbitrator or a court order, you agree that any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and NeighborMe must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in the State of California. You and NeighborMe agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within the State of California for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes.
    <br>
    <br>17. No Agency
    <br>Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as making either party the partner, joint venturer, agent, legal representative, employer, contractor or employee of the other. Neither party shall have, or hold itself out to any third party as having any authority to make any statements, representations or commitments of any kind, or to take any action, that shall be binding on the other, except as provided for herein or authorized in writing by the party to be bound.
    <br>
    <br>18. General Provisions
    <br>Failure by NeighborMe to enforce any provision(s) of these Terms will not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and NeighborMe with respect to its subject matter. The invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of any term or provision of these Terms shall in no way effect the validity, legality or enforceability of any other term or provision of these Terms. In the event a term or provision is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and these Terms shall be enforceable as so modified.
